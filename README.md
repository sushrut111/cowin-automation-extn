# Disclaimer
Many other developers have created scripts to book vaccine slots automatically -  due to this, those who do not know how to use those scripts are facing issues while searching for vaccine slots. 
I made this extension to counter that - anyone will be able to use this extension very easily even if they do not know how it works.
I am not charging anything for this - this will be FREE of cost forever. I also have created support channel to help people use this extension if they have difficulties.


Because everyone has equal right to get vaccinated on time!


**Never pay anyone to book a vaccine slot**
